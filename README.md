# General Information

This project was developed in the sixth semester of the Bachelor's degree program Mechatronics/Robotics at the UAS Technikum Wien for the mobile and service robots lecture.

The basic principles of mobile robots:
- forward kinematics
- linear motion control
- search-based path planning using a BFS algorithm
have been implemented in a ROS Gazebo simulation.
